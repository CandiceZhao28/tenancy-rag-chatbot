COMMUNICATION 

The Landlord and Tenant agree that all communications which may or must be made under the Act and in relation to this Agreement, including notices to be served by one party on the other will be made in writing using:

   hard copy by personal delivery or recorded delivery; or

 X  the email addresses set out in clauses [2 or 3] and 1].

For communication by email it is essential that the Landlord(s) and Tenant(s) consider carefully whether this option is suitable for them.  It should be noted that all notices will be sent by email, which includes important documents such as a rent-increase notice and a notice to leave the Let Property.

To ensure all emails can be received and read in good time, the Landlord(s) and Tenant(s) agree to inform each other as soon as possible of any new email address which is to be used instead of the email address notified in this Agreement. 

If sending a document electronically or by recorded delivery post, the document will be regarded as having been received 48 hours after it was sent, unless the receiving party can provide proof that he or she received it later than this.  This extra delivery time should be factored into any required notice period.

OCCUPATION AND USE OF THE LET PROPERTY

The Tenant agrees to continue to occupy the Let Property as his or her home and must obtain the Landlord’s written permission before carrying out any trade, business or profession there. 


RENT 

The rent is £950 a calendar month payable in advance

The first payment will be paid before _4_/_11_/_2023_ and will be for the sum of £4750 in respect of the period _15_/_11_/_2023_ to _14_/_03_/_2024_. (The maximum amount of rent which can be paid in advance is 6 months’ rent.)

Thereafter payments of £950 must be received on or before 14th of each calendar month and then subsequently on or before the same date each calendar month thereafter.

RENT RECEIPTS

Where any payment of rent is made in cash, the Landlord must provide the Tenant with a dated written receipt for the payment stating: the amount paid, and either (as the case may be) the amount which remains outstanding, or confirmation that no further amount remains outstanding. 


RENT INCREASES

The rent cannot be increased more than once in any twelve month period and the Landlord must give the Tenant at least three months’ notice before any increase can take place.  In order to increase the rent, the Landlord must give the Tenant a rent-increase notice, the content of which is set out in ‘The Private Residential Tenancies (Prescribed Notices and Forms) (Scotland) Regulations 2017’. The notice will be sent using the communication method agreed in the ‘Communication’ clause above.


DEPOSIT 


At the start date of the tenancy or before, a deposit of £950 will be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord. The Landlord will issue a receipt for the deposit to the Tenant.  No interest shall be paid by the Landlord to the Tenant for the deposit.  

By law, the deposit amount cannot exceed the equivalent of two months’ rent and cannot include any premiums. For example, charging for an administration fee or taking a holding fee (regardless of whether or not the holding fee is refundable).

Where it is provided in this Agreement that the Tenant is responsible for a particular cost or to do any particular thing and the Tenant fails to meet that cost, or the Landlord carries out work or performs any other obligation for which the Tenant is responsible, the Landlord can apply for reasonable costs to be deducted from any deposit paid by the Tenant.  

This would include cases where a tenant has not paid all of the rent payable, any amount in respect of one-off services, or unpaid utility bills, or a sum in relation to breakages or cleaning.

At the end of the tenancy the Landlord should ask the tenancy deposit scheme to release the deposit and the amounts payable to each party. If the Tenant disagrees with the amount, the scheme administrator will provide a dispute resolution mechanism.

Where the Tenant owes the Landlord an amount greater than the amount held by the tenancy deposit scheme, the Tenant will remain liable for these costs, and the Landlord may take action to recover the difference from the Tenant.
